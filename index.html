<h1>IT Assessment 1</h1>
 <h2>Profile</h2>
  <h3>Name:</h3>
   <p>Madeleine Dupree</p>
  <h3>Student Number:</h3>
   <p>S3879009</p>
  <h3>Photo:</h3>
 
  <h3>Basic Background Information:</h3>
   <p>I am a 23-year-old Australian woman with English and Irish heritage. Both my family and I have grown up in Victoria, Australia and speak only English. I live with my mum and brother and we have plenty of extended family nearby. I own an adopted dog named Max who is a Jack Russel Terrier crossed with something fluffy. I own a variety of pet fish, mostly betta fish, some community fish and a goldfish. I have a Certificate III in Community Services and a Diploma of Healthcare Documentation.  I work two part time jobs, one as a checkout chick for Woolworths and the other as a medical transcriptionist.</p>
  <h3>What Is Your Interest In IT?</h3> 
   <p>Ever since I started using computers as a kid, I have always had to learn to use them on my own. This started with troubleshooting how to run the game Pinball on my dad’s first computer when it was slow to load and often crashed. My next hurdle was in mid-primary school and came with having to write and decorate my first project on a computer using Microsoft Word with no instructions, guidance or prior experience - besides Pinball obviously. Many challenges like this arose during high school when I was supplied with a well-loved second-hand computer accompanied with some very nasty technical support staff. It was much simpler to resolve my ongoing mild-moderate computer issues on my own.<p>
   <p>All of this has leas to me becoming the very persistent - though still basic - technical support representative in my family. I resolve WiFi dropouts, Facebook queries, iPhone/iPad troubles and all number of concerns with Windows computers. I spend moments or many hors resolving these issues - in fact as I write this I multitasking and fixing my stepdad’s iPad in the background. My interest in IT stems from necessity and has turned into curiosity.<p>
   <p>A few weeks ago, my mum recognised a basic skill that I have in this area and how much I would benefit from having more skill in this area. So, she suggested that I look into studying and making a career of it. That is when I started looking into IT courses and if I was able to study online. Open Universities Australia basically took the reins, directed me towards RMIT and got me enrolled very quickly. I was also considering Deakin but I liked the sound of RMIT’s 13-week terms and the support available for students.<p>
  <h3>What Do You Expect to Learn During Your Studies?</h3>
   <p>As I am only enrolled in the Introduction to Information Technology at this stage, I hope to get a sense of whether IT is the career that I want to pursue further. I still have a lot of uncertainty about my career options and I am not as instinctually drawn to computers as others are, but I wish to put in my best effort to make it worthwhile.<p>
 <h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
  <h3>Job Title:</h3>
   <p>IT Support Officer</p>
  <h3>Job Listing Information:</h3>
   <p>IT Support Officer at SANE Australia. Here is the job description on the <a href="https://www.sane.org/careers-at-sane" target="_blank">SANE Australia Website</a></p>
   <p>Here is a snapshot of that webpage:</p>

  <h3>Why does job appeal to me?</h3>
   <p>I have had an interest in mental health and community services before. I studied it for a little while at TAFE and found that it wasn’t the kind of work that I ultimately wanted to do. However, I would much like to work behind the scenes and provide technical support for a great organisation that provides mental health services. I find that most mental health service providers have similar values to my own and working for SANE Australia may be a good way for me to combine my interests.</p>
  <h3>What qualifications are required?</h3>
   <p>A TAFE certificate/diploma, bachelor’s degree or other relevant training in IT.</p>
  <h3>What skills/experience is required?</h3>

   <p>Certificate III in Community Services and Diploma of Healthcare Documentation, neither of which are required for this job application so I must work towards obtaining a Bachelor of Information Technology over the next few years.</p>
  <h3>What skills/experience do I currently have?</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Strictly personal experience using Windows 10 systems and IOS.</li>
    <li>A basic understanding of installing/running some aspects of Microsoft Office for personal use.</li>
    <li>Past customer service skills as a supermarket deli and checkout team member.</li>
    <li>Ability to troubleshoot while using Windows and IOS in my personal life.</li>
    <li>Previous training in community services, particularly regarding communicating or working with a range of people in a respectful and inclusive way.</li>
    <li>Previous/current experience working in a team to complete a wide range of tasks. This involves:</li>
     <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
      <li>Serving customers.</li>
      <li>Communicating in a respectful, kind and understanding way when helping both staff and customers.</li>
      <li>Managing a long list of tasks in a timely manner.</li>

      <li>Actively listening and transcribing verbatim.</li>
      <li>Attention to detail by ensuring the correct information is recorded (spelling, grammar, medications, dosage and dates).</li>
     </ul>
   </ul>
  <h3>How do I plan to gain the skills I need for this job or other jobs I may wish to apply for in the future?</h3>
   <p>Firstly, I plan to keep up to date with what sort of skills employers are looking for in the IT industry. This will involve being aware of what systems, software, hardware, networks, programs, applications and methods are most commonly used by a variety of companies. In this case, I am already aware that I need to learn how to use Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Office, Box, Asana and Helpdesk.</p>
   <p>Next, I will endeavour to learn these skills during my time doing the bachelor. I believe I will naturally gain some skill with the Microsoft programs throughout the course. However, Box, Asana and Helpdesk may require more conscious effort. Asana is a free app that I could learn to use in my personal time, simply by downloading it and browsing to get started. When it comes to learning to use Helpdesk, I think I might need to learn how to use it on the job because it involves interacting with customers. But they do offer one month free so I could download it and have a browse anyway. In other cases, I could take classes to gain skills in these areas.</p>
<h1>Personality Tests</h1>
 <h2>Myers-Briggs/16Personalities</h2>
    <h3>My Perspective Prior To The Test</h3>
     <p>I have done this test several years ago and did not feel like the result described me very well. I have also heard of conflicting opinions about the accuracy of this test as well as other personality tests like it. However, I gave the test the benefit of the doubt in order to give it another go. I used <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" target="_blank">this website</a> to do the test:</p>
    <h3>My Test Results</h3>
     <p>My result for the Myers-Briggs/16Personalities states that I am an ISFP-T, otherwise known as the “Adventurer”. Initially I thought that they must have gotten my result wrong because I wouldn’t label myself as adventurous unless it is the way of picking up random hobbies that I can practice in my own home (such as knitting, crochet, art or puzzles) and almost never to completion. This was also a different answer to my result in the past but again, that was several years ago. I have collected a list of things that I think I have in common with the description of an Adventurer and things I do not have in common.</p>
    <h3>Things I Have in Common:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>Creative/artistic - somewhat, I don’t often use this skill anymore.</li>
      <li>Introverted - definitely.</li>
      <li>Breaks tradition - somewhat.</li>
      <li>Don’t take criticism well if it is not stated maturely - I think that is how most people feel?</li>
      <li>Sensitive to others’ feelings and value harmony - yes very much so.</li>
      <li>Don’t plan for the future in terms of money or achievements but instead plan based on what they want their identity/personality to be - somewhat. I don’t really make long term plans.</li>
      <li>Can be charitable and selfless - somewhat, though I do prefer to focus on looking after myself these days, rather than looking after others like I have in the past.</li>
      <li>Passionate underneath shyness - I am passionate about some things but not shy.</li>
      <li>Curious but not very science focussed - Sort of, I am both curious and a strong believer in science and finding realistic explanations to questions I might have.</li>
      <li>Fiercely independent - I am very independent. This is labelled as an Adventurer’s weakness but I disagree as it is one of my favourite qualities. They also use the word “independent” quite differently to how I would, using it as a description of someone who breaks traditions while I would use it to describe someone who does not rely on others for support in their personal life. When it comes to working in teams or professional environments, I would much prefer to have specific goals and instructions in order to reduce complications.</li>
      <li>Easily stressed - absolutely, I am often stressed.</li>
      <li>Live in the present - a little, though I definitely think about the past quite often.</li>
      <li>Fluctuating self-esteem - I guess my self-esteem in regard to my skills fluctuates a little but I am generally confident or at least not concerned about this.</li>
     </ul>
    <h3>Things I Do Not Have in Common:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>Spontaneous - hardly ever. I enjoy making short-term plans for upcoming events/occasions. This includes making lists, budgeting, setting timeframes and preparing. Once I have figured out if the idea is plausible and a good choice to make, then I will act on it.</li>
      <li>Live in a colourful/sensual world - no my life is fairly uneventful.</li>
      <li>Have many connections with people - I don’t look for socialisation and have only one or two friends.</li>
      <li>Like to reinterpret/reinvent/experiment with their connections, themselves and their perspectives - not really, I know I don’t stick to tradition but I’m not really going about at changing different aspect of my life.</li>
      <li>Unpredictable - I would say I am pretty predictable as I will continue on the same path unless there is a good reason for me to change. Although, the test uses this word to describe someone who does not like making long term plans, which I don’t, but that’s not how I would define the word “unpredictable” so I am a little confused about this one.</li>
      <li>After turning inwards through introversion, they return transformed.</li>
      <li>Push their passions.</li>
      <li>Are risk takers and enjoy gambling or extreme sports - definitely not, I don’t gamble and I don’t like sport much.</li>
      <li>Have an irresistible charm - no, generally people don’t seem drawn to me or repelled by me.</li>
      <li>Can be selfish and manipulative - even though I prefer to focus on myself rather than others, I actively avoid being selfish and manipulative.</li>
      <li>Imaginative - I am more practical than imaginative.</li>
      <li>Overly competitive - I can be competitive sometimes in board games but other than that, I never seek out competitive environments.</li>
      <li>Don’t like instructions and prefer to do things their own way - if the instructions are safe and achieve the goal then I will always prefer specific instructions.</li>
     </ul>
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
     <p>These is just what I have gained from the first few pages that describe Adventurers. I do not feel like much of an Adventurer at all. Although, I did find that I learned a little about myself simply by thinking about how the description of an Adventurer probably does not fit me.</p>
    <h3>How Will These Results Affect Me and My Participation in a Team?</h3>
     <p>The results of this particular test do not mean much for me and I think will have no influence on my behaviour in a team or how I should form a team. I believe I am a pretty good team member as I like to contribute evenly, actively and enthusiastically - even if I would prefer to work on my own. It is difficult for the whole team when some members aren’t actively contributing to the team and so I personally try my best to be a helpful team member. I also do not like it when things are left undone and often find myself picking up the slack or completing the tasks that others have not.</p>
   <h2>What Is My Learning Style?</h2>
    <h3>My Perspective Prior To The Test</h3>
     <p>I have previously said in the past that I am a tactile/kinaesthetic learner and I also benefit from learning visually. This is because:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>I prefer to hand write my notes/homework before typing them up.</li>
       <li>I can often replicate drawings I did long ago.</li>
       <li>I am good at puzzles.</li>
       <li>I sometimes fiddle with objects in class.</li>
       <li>I often sketch art on all of my workbooks while listening to teachers.</li>
     <p>I find that I listen better when I am moving my hands and retain written information if I rewrite it in my own way. In a class environment, I usually I end up sketching on my books or multitasking while listening. I find that I do not learn anything and get very bored when listening to teachers unless:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>The teacher is enthusiastic.</li>
       <li>The class is fast-paced.</li>
       <li>There are visuals accompanying the voice.</li>
       <li>I am doing something with my hands and/or.</li>
       <li>If the content is appealing/challenging to me.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>My Tests Results</h3> 
     <p>I used <a href="http://www.whatismylearningstyle.com/index.html" target="_blank">this website</a> to see what my learning style is. I tried tests 1, 2 and 3 on this website. Test 1 says I am a visual learner. Test 2 says I am evenly split between a visual and tactile/kinaesthetic learner (see image 1 below). Test 3 says that I have mostly analytic tendencies, though I still have plenty of global tendencies (see image 2 below).</p>
       <p>Image 1:</p>
       <img src="Learning Styles Test 2 Results.png" height="200">
       <p>Image 2:</p>
       
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
     <p>Test 1 suggests that I am a visual learner rather than a tactile/kinaesthetic learner. After reading through what defines a visual learner, I would say that I agree with most of the descriptions and suggestions. I do think for me it is very important to consider the physical side of my learning too, as it is definitely present.</p>
     <p>Test 2 suggested an even split between visual learning and tactile/kinaesthetic learning. I think this is much more accurate than test 1. Although, I think test 1 does not allow for a combined result so that may explain why test 2 is more accurate it my case. When reading up on both of these learning styles I found I associated with both of them evenly but not completely, which matches the results of test 2.</p>
     <p>Test 3 says that I have mostly analytic tendencies, though I still have plenty of global tendencies. I pretty much agree with this result after reading through all of the information provided.</p>
     <p>Based on all three test results and my personal experience I know for sure that I am not an auditory learner. I learn best through a combination of learning materials and styles.</p>
    <h3>How Will These Results Affect Me and My Participation in a Team?</h3>
     <p>I think these results mean that I may benefit from written communication from my team in addition to or in place of verbal communication in a team. Seeing as this is not always convenient to ask of others, I may instead supplement in-person or video conversations by making my own lists, some group goals and/or organising group thoughts into written word. I do not think the results of this learning style test will impact my behaviour in a group much too much, other than putting in a tiny bit more effort in regard to writing things down. Seeing as I am studying online and most of the work is in written word, any adaptations that I have will likely be easy to do and perhaps benefit multiple members of the group. I’m really sure that my learning style is going to come into play when forming teams now or in the future, seeing as I do not know what other peoples’ learning styles are and most teams do not choose their members based on their learning style anyway. It really only impacts how I retain information during group chats which I can do just fine by writing it down. I’m pretty sure it doesn’t impact anyone else.</p>
   <h2>The Big Five Personality Test</h2>
    <h3>My Perspective Prior To The Test</h3>
     <p>I actually haven’t heard much about this test before so it is fairly new to me. I don’t have an opinion or perspective prior to doing this test.</p>
    <h3>My Test Results</h3>
     <p><a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test" target="_blank">Here</a> is the website I used to do the Big Five Personality Test.Here is the initial result of the test, showing my degree of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism:</p>
     
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
     <p>My openness is the lowest score at 44%, stating that I am more “practical, conventional, and focused on the concrete” and less “creative, adventurous, and intellectual”. While I believe that I am practical, I do not like to stick to conventions or to completely focus on what is concrete. I do like to find alternative solutions to problems through intelligent thinking and creativity, if possible. I generally do not dwell on creative or adventurous ideas if they are not plausible. I think a score of around 44% is accurate for me.</p>
     <p>My conscientiousness is my second highest score at 65%, stating that I am more “organized and determined” and less “impulsive and easily sidetracked”. I think that I am more organised than impulsive but I would not say that I am particularly determined or focussed. I think a score of around 65% is accurate for me.</p>
     <p>My extraversion is my second lowest score at 46%, stating that I am more “more content with simple, quiet lives, and rarely seek attention from others” and less likely to “engage actively with others to earn friendship, admiration, power, status, excitement, and romance”. I am surprised this score is not lower, seeing as I associate more with the description of a quiet life but I do like to spend some time with some people (i.e. family) so perhaps that is why it is higher than I expected. I think a score of around 46% is fairly accurate for me.</p>
     <p>My agreeableness is my mid-ground score at 54%, stating that I am slightly more likely to “cooperate rather than compete with others” and less “hostile, competitive, and antagonistic”. I do believe that I like to be agreeable, helpful, kind or at least passive in social situations but I do prefer to be on my own. I think a score of around 54% is accurate for me.</p>
     <p>My neuroticism score is my highest score at 69%, stating that I am more likely to “experience negative emotions, including fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt, and shame” and less likely to “brush off my misfortune and move on”. I would agree that I do experience more stress, worry and fear than the average person but not to a debilitating degree at this stage. I think a score of around 69% is accurate for me. 
    <h3>How Will These Results Affect Me and My Participation in a Team?</h3>
     <p>I think these results will impact my and my team the most. As a team member I am more likely to do the paperwork rather than come up with ideas. I may be able to assist with organisation and guide people back to the topic at hand. I probably will not be the best conversationalist or very good at boosting morale but I will try. I will probably try to keep things civil during team conflicts but resolving conflicts is not one of my best skills. I will stress/worry about getting teamwork done and any issues that the team is facing. I think I could resolve some of these issues by working on my people skills, ensuring my part of the team project is complete well in advance and trying to support others if they are struggling.</p>
   <h1>Project Idea</h1>
    <h2>A Pet Keeping Information App</h2>
     <h3>What Is the Idea?</h3>
      <p>I wish to create an app that provides an exhaustive collection of information on a wide variety of pets. I hope this app provides valuable information for new or old pet owners in order to increase the general wellbeing of their beloved friends.</p>
     <h3>Why Is It Important/Interesting?</h3>
      <p>A 2019 study done by <a href="https://animalmedicinesaustralia.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ANIM001-Pet-Survey-Report19_v1.7_WEB_high-res.pdf" target="_blank">Animal Medicines Australia</a>shows that “61% of Australian households have a pet”. Most of those pets are dogs (40%) or cats (27%), with over 60% of owners describing their pet as a member of the family. Australia also has higher rates of pet ownership than both the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>These high pet ownership rates tell me that Australians really love having animal companions around. I would like my app to provide support to the many people who already own pets and anyone who is looking to get a pet in the future.</p>
      <p>This app is important because there are many myths, missing information, misinformation and dangerous information in pet keeping. I wish for my app to provide safe information for the huge population of Australian pet owners. I also hope to directly link pet owners to all of the basic and complex information about their individual pets. I imagine this app could aid people and pets by:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Reducing the frequency of preventable illnesses.</li>
        <li>Informing people of a pet’s care requirements before or after they welcome a pet into their home.</li>
        <li>Providing training guides to reduce behavioural problems or increase the bond between owners and pets.</li>
        <li>Linking pet owners to invaluable products and resources.</li>
        <li>Encouraging responsible pet ownership or reducing cases of neglect.</li>
        <li>Providing easy/quick access for the user, saving time often spent sifting through the internet to find trustworthy information.</li>
        <li>Giving answers to the most FAQs that owners have about many kinds of pets.</li>
       </ul>
     <h3>What Are the Drawbacks of This App or The Potential Obstacles I May Face?</h3>
      <p>This app would require a lot of input from experts such as vets or pet trainers. This would require much research, collaboration, time and potentially money to pay for their input. Unfortunately, while pet care is a passion/hobby of mine, I am neither qualified nor an expert in this area. Therefore, after developing my skills in IT I could create, run and manage the app but I will not be able to create the core content it displays. At this stage I do not have any connections to vets, pet trainers or animal experts of any kind. I would need to make these connections in order to make the app fully functional. This may be quite interesting for me so not necessarily a drawback.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, or in some cases, instead of uploading original information to the app I could simply direct users to external - but still trustworthy - resources. This might involve writing a description of what the resource is, how the resource is helpful and then linking to the external website. Though I foresee that being an issue if I wish to make money from this app. Encouraging the consumer to leave or close the app is not ideal. I am not sure how but I think it is possible to display someone else’s content - such as a dog training YouTube video - on my app while still crediting the creator and ensuring that the creator’s potential profit on the video is not hindered. I believe I would need to “imbed” the YouTube video into a part of my app, that way the user can watch it and seamlessly return to learning about pet care within the app.</p>
      <p>If I do wish to create some of my own content (e.g. in-app mini games or fun facts) I could reference articles, research, etc. That way I would not need to employ/ask other people to supply the content.</p>
      <p>On top of that, I have never made an app before and have little/no experience in the IT sector. I have a lot to learn before I will see this app come to life.</p>
     <h3>What Features Will the App Have?</h3>
      <p>The app will include a long list of features that I hope will be useful to all pet users. I plan to start with the first 1-3 features on this list and add the rest of the resources later as I learn more about what is plausible.</p>
     <ol>
      <li><b>Pet Care Guides</b></li>
       <p>I intend for the Pet Care Guides to inform users on the basic or complex needs of a variety of pets. The aim for this feature is to help users choose suitable animals to join their families and prevent unexpected complications. Many thousands of pets end up in shelters every year, many of which are surrendered due to pet keepers not anticipating the care requirements of their pets before purchasing them. My app will provide an easy way for people to learn about their pets before purchasing or adopting their new friend.</p>
      <li><b>FAQ/Frequently Asked Questions</b></li>
       <p>I would like to include a Frequently Asked Questions section so that users can find answers promptly. Often pet keepers wonder things like “can my dog eat this?” or “is this toy safe for my dog to play with?” and the answers that are given at pet stores are not always accurate. For example, rawhide dog treats and some rope toys are not safe for dogs to play with or consume, despite them often being sold at pet stores. If dog keepers had access to a FAQ hub of accurate information then they could find answers to these very important questions with ease. Initially I would begin by basing the questions off of Google’s most frequently asked pet questions but I would eventually like to cater the questions to what the users of the app are most interested in knowing about.</p>
      <li><b>Fun Facts</b></li>
       <p>Let’s face it, animals are weird and wonderful beings. The way that they adapt to their environments amazes humans and makes us curious to know more. The Fun Facts feature aims to encourage this curiosity and make our pet keeping research fun and engaging. This feature would include facts about both domesticated and wild animals. I will probably make this a weekly or daily feature, rather than just a constant list of facts. I hope that will encourage ongoing learning and education within the app. This may be a pop-up feature within the app that doesn’t take up much of the reader’s time. Alternatively, it could appear on the loading screen or as a daily/weekly notification in the mornings.</p>
      <li><b>Pet Profile</b></li>
       <p>This is where the user can fill in some basic information about their pet so that the app can suggest related information to the user. This may include fill in sections such as the pets name and drop-down boxes for species, breed and age.</p>
      <li><b>Breed Information</b></li>
       <p>Within the pet keeping hobby there are many breeds and crossbreeds that people recognise and love. There are also many breeds that people have never heard of that they may wish to know more about. This section will mostly cater to the owners of dogs due to their long list of breeds and vastly different features. Temperament, appearance, energy level, common illnesses, grooming requirements and size vary greatly depending on the dog breed. This information is valuable to me and to others who are also passionate about their pets.<p>
      <li><b>Latest Research/Articles</b></li>
       <p>The “Latest Research” or “Articles” section will share the most recent information being talked about in the news, magazines or online. This section is for the animal lovers who want who are passionate about all fauna found on earth. This may include animal research, trending footage, documentary recommendations, discoveries, endangered species, the impact of climate change on animals and much more. I will need to be able to imbed these articles into my app or provide links to external websites.</p>
      <li><b>Quick Tips</b></li>
       <p>The Quick Tips section will function similarly to the Fun Facts section in that it may only be a daily or weekly feature via a pop-up, loading screen or notification. These could be catered to the user by using their basic pet info to supply relevant tips. E.g. Dog owners would receive tips on dog care and turtle owners would receive tips on turtle care.<p>
      <li><b>Training Guides</b></li>
       <p>The Training Guide section would include embedded or links to YouTube videos on some of the best training advice available. This will hopefully encourage pet exercise, promote bonding and reduce difficult or dangerous behaviours.</p>
      <li><b>Essential Supplies</b></li>
       <p>The Essential Supplies section will direct users towards the most important items, the must have products that they for their pet’s care. This may be an opportunity to include affiliate links and provide a source of income rather than using advertisements. I wish for this section include top quality items, to just products that will make a quick buck. This would likely involve linking to external websites seeing as I would not be selling the products within my app.</p>
      <li><b>Merchandise</b></li>
       <p>I may one day include a Merchandise section that includes pet care items of my own creation. This may be another form of income for the app in the future. This would involve creating an in-app store or perhaps creating my own external website and linking to it. Either way this would involve a lot of research into privacy, security, online transactions and how to set that up within the app/website.</p>
      <li><b>Connect to A Vet</b></li>
       <p>An in-app chat feature that connects users directly to vets to receive general medical advice. I foresee some issues with this as vet care almost always requires examining the patient to accurately identify or rule out common issues. But general questions or behavioural advicemay be answered by using this feature.</p>
      </ol>
       <h3>Tools and Technologies Needed</h3>
       <p>Seeing as I have never made an app before, I plan to use MIT App Inventor or something similar to bring the app to life. I am not sure how MIT App Inventor works but it seems like it may help me a lot along the way.</p>
       <p>In order to make the app or use the MIT App Inventor website I will need a computer. I currently have a Windows computer that should suffice.</p>
       <p>I think I will need at least one type of mobile device in order to make the app. This is to see what the app looks like, how well it works, run tests and eventually present it to the public. I currently have an iPhone and so will likely use that to get started. I do not have access to android phones at the moment. I would like to make my app accessible to as many people as possible so I would need to consider that in the future.</p>
