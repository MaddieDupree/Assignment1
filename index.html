<h1>IT Assessment 1</h1>
 <h2>Profile</h2>
  <h3>Name:</h3>
   <p>Madeleine Dupree</p>
  <h3>Student Number:</h3>

  <h3>Basic Background Information:</h3>
   <p>I am a 23-year-old Australian woman with English and Irish heritage. Both my family and I have grown up in Victoria, Australia and speak only English. I live with my mum and brother and we have plenty of extended family nearby. I own an adopted dog named Max who is a Jack Russel Terrier crossed with something fluffy. I own a variety of pet fish, mostly betta fish, some community fish and a goldfish. I have a Certificate III in Community Services and a Diploma of Healthcare Documentation.  I work two part time jobs, one as a checkout chick for Woolworths and the other as a medical transcriptionist.</p>
  <h3>What Is Your Interest In IT?</h3> 
   <p>Ever since I started using computers as a kid, I have always had to learn to use them on my own. This started with troubleshooting how to run the game Pinball on my dad’s first computer when it was slow to load and often crashed. My next hurdle was in mid-primary school and came with having to write and decorate my first project on a computer using Microsoft Word with no instructions, guidance or prior experience - besides Pinball obviously. Many challenges like this arose during high school when I was supplied with a well-loved second-hand computer accompanied with some very nasty technical support staff. It was much simpler to resolve my ongoing mild-moderate computer issues on my own.<p>
   <p>All of this has leas to me becoming the very persistent - though still basic - technical support representative in my family. I resolve WiFi dropouts, Facebook queries, iPhone/iPad troubles and all number of concerns with Windows computers. I spend moments or many hors resolving these issues - in fact as I write this I multitasking and fixing my stepdad’s iPad in the background. My interest in IT stems from necessity and has turned into curiosity.<p>
   <p>A few weeks ago, my mum recognised a basic skill that I have in this area and how much I would benefit from having more skill in this area. So, she suggested that I look into studying and making a career of it. That is when I started looking into IT courses and if I was able to study online. Open Universities Australia basically took the reins, directed me towards RMIT and got me enrolled very quickly. I was also considering Deakin but I liked the sound of RMIT’s 13-week terms and the support available for students.<p>
  <h3>What Do You Expect to Learn During Your Studies?</h3>
   <p>As I am only enrolled in the Introduction to Information Technology at this stage, I hope to get a sense of whether IT is the career that I want to pursue further. I still have a lot of uncertainty about my career options and I am not as instinctually drawn to computers as others are, but I wish to put in my best effort to make it worthwhile.<p>

This may involve tasks like troubleshooting, testing, installing and coaching in these areas, all while being guided by SANE’s core values.</p>
  <h3>Why does job appeal to me?</h3>
   <p>I have had an interest in mental health and community services before. I studied it for a little while at TAFE and found that it wasn’t the kind of work that I ultimately wanted to do. However, I would much like to work behind the scenes and provide technical support for a great organisation that provides mental health services. I find that most mental health service providers have similar values to my own and working for SANE Australia may be a good way for me to combine my interests.</p>
