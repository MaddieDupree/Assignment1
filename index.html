<h3>Basic Background Information:</h3>
<p>I am a 23-year-old Australian woman with English and Irish heritage. Both my family and I have grown up in Victoria, Australia and speak only English. I live with my mum and brother and we have plenty of extended family nearby. I own an adopted dog named Max who is a Jack Russel Terrier crossed with something fluffy. I own a variety of pet fish, mostly betta fish, some community fish and a goldfish. I have a Certificate III in Community Services and a Diploma of Healthcare Documentation.  I work two part time jobs, one as a checkout chick for Woolworths and the other as a medical transcriptionist.</p>
