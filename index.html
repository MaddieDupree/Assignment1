<h1>IT Assessment 1</h1>
 <h2>Profile</h2>
  <h3>Name:</h3>
   <p>Madeleine Dupree</p>
  <h3>Student Number:</h3>
   <p>S3879009</p>

  <h3>Basic Background Information:</h3>
   <p>I am a 23-year-old Australian woman with English and Irish heritage. Both my family and I have grown up in Victoria, Australia and speak only English. I live with my mum and brother and we have plenty of extended family nearby. I own an adopted dog named Max who is a Jack Russel Terrier crossed with something fluffy. I own a variety of pet fish, mostly betta fish, some community fish and a goldfish. I have a Certificate III in Community Services and a Diploma of Healthcare Documentation.  I work two part time jobs, one as a checkout chick for Woolworths and the other as a medical transcriptionist.</p>
  <h3>What Is Your Interest In IT?</h3> 
   <p>Ever since I started using computers as a kid, I have always had to learn to use them on my own. This started with troubleshooting how to run the game Pinball on my dad’s first computer when it was slow to load and often crashed. My next hurdle was in mid-primary school and came with having to write and decorate my first project on a computer using Microsoft Word with no instructions, guidance or prior experience - besides Pinball obviously. Many challenges like this arose during high school when I was supplied with a well-loved second-hand computer accompanied with some very nasty technical support staff. It was much simpler to resolve my ongoing mild-moderate computer issues on my own.<p>
   <p>All of this has leas to me becoming the very persistent - though still basic - technical support representative in my family. I resolve WiFi dropouts, Facebook queries, iPhone/iPad troubles and all number of concerns with Windows computers. I spend moments or many hors resolving these issues - in fact as I write this I multitasking and fixing my stepdad’s iPad in the background. My interest in IT stems from necessity and has turned into curiosity.<p>
   <p>A few weeks ago, my mum recognised a basic skill that I have in this area and how much I would benefit from having more skill in this area. So, she suggested that I look into studying and making a career of it. That is when I started looking into IT courses and if I was able to study online. Open Universities Australia basically took the reins, directed me towards RMIT and got me enrolled very quickly. I was also considering Deakin but I liked the sound of RMIT’s 13-week terms and the support available for students.<p>
  <h3>What Do You Expect to Learn During Your Studies?</h3>
   <p>As I am only enrolled in the Introduction to Information Technology at this stage, I hope to get a sense of whether IT is the career that I want to pursue further. I still have a lot of uncertainty about my career options and I am not as instinctually drawn to computers as others are, but I wish to put in my best effort to make it worthwhile.<p>

   <p>Here are the snapshots of that position description:</p>
   
  <h3>Position description:</h3>
   <p>The job involves providing technical support for staff members at SANE Australia, maintaining the IT systems used by the organisation and making sure their data and patient/client information is secure. This may involve tasks like troubleshooting, testing, installing and coaching in these areas, all while being guided by SANE’s core values.</p>
  <h3>Why does job appeal to me?</h3>
   <p>I have had an interest in mental health and community services before. I studied it for a little while at TAFE and found that it wasn’t the kind of work that I ultimately wanted to do. However, I would much like to work behind the scenes and provide technical support for a great organisation that provides mental health services. I find that most mental health service providers have similar values to my own and working for SANE Australia may be a good way for me to combine my interests.</p>
  <h3>What qualifications are required?</h3>

  <h3>What skills/experience is required?</h3>

   </ul>
  <h3>What qualifications do I currently have?</h3>
   <p>Certificate III in Community Services and Diploma of Healthcare Documentation, neither of which are required for this job application so I must work towards obtaining a Bachelor of Information Technology over the next few years.</p>
  <h3>What skills/experience do I currently have?</h3>

    <li>Previous training in community services, particularly regarding communicating or working with a range of people in a respectful and inclusive way.</li>
    <li>Previous/current experience working in a team to complete a wide range of tasks. This involves:</li>
     <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
      <li>Serving customers.</li>
      <li>Communicating in a respectful, kind and understanding way when helping both staff and customers.</li>

      <li>Actively listening and transcribing verbatim.</li>
      <li>Attention to detail by ensuring the correct information is recorded (spelling, grammar, medications, dosage and dates).</li>
  <h3>How do I plan to gain the skills I need for this job or other jobs I may wish to apply for in the future?</h3>
   <p>Firstly, I plan to keep up to date with what sort of skills employers are looking for in the IT industry. This will involve being aware of what systems, software, hardware, networks, programs, applications and methods are most commonly used by a variety of companies. In this case, I am already aware that I need to learn how to use Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Office, Box, Asana and Helpdesk.</p>
   <p>Next, I will endeavour to learn these skills during my time doing the bachelor. I believe I will naturally gain some skill with the Microsoft programs throughout the course. However, Box, Asana and Helpdesk may require more conscious effort. Asana is a free app that I could learn to use in my personal time, simply by downloading it and browsing to get started. When it comes to learning to use Helpdesk, I think I might need to learn how to use it on the job because it involves interacting with customers. But they do offer one month free so I could download it and have a browse anyway. In other cases, I could take classes to gain skills in these areas.</p>
<h1>Personality Tests</h1>
 <h2>Myers-Briggs/16Personalities</h2>
    <h3>My Perspective Prior To The Test</h3>
     <p>I have done this test several years ago and did not feel like the result described me very well. I have also heard of conflicting opinions about the accuracy of this test as well as other personality tests like it. However, I gave the test the benefit of the doubt in order to give it another go. I used <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" target="_blank">this website</a> to do the test:</p>
    <h3>My Test Results</h3>
     <p>My result for the Myers-Briggs/16Personalities states that I am an ISFP-T, otherwise known as the “Adventurer”. Initially I thought that they must have gotten my result wrong because I wouldn’t label myself as adventurous unless it is the way of picking up random hobbies that I can practice in my own home (such as knitting, crochet, art or puzzles) and almost never to completion. This was also a different answer to my result in the past but again, that was several years ago. I have collected a list of things that I think I have in common with the description of an Adventurer and things I do not have in common.</p>
    <h3>Things I Have in Common:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>Creative/artistic - somewhat, I don’t often use this skill anymore.</li>
      <li>Introverted - definitely.</li>
      <li>Breaks tradition - somewhat.</li>
      <li>Don’t take criticism well if it is not stated maturely - I think that is how most people feel?</li>
      <li>Sensitive to others’ feelings and value harmony - yes very much so.</li>
      <li>Don’t plan for the future in terms of money or achievements but instead plan based on what they want their identity/personality to be - somewhat. I don’t really make long term plans.</li>
      <li>Can be charitable and selfless - somewhat, though I do prefer to focus on looking after myself these days, rather than looking after others like I have in the past.</li>
      <li>Passionate underneath shyness - I am passionate about some things but not shy.</li>
      <li>Curious but not very science focussed - Sort of, I am both curious and a strong believer in science and finding realistic explanations to questions I might have.</li>
      <li>Fiercely independent - I am very independent. This is labelled as an Adventurer’s weakness but I disagree as it is one of my favourite qualities. They also use the word “independent” quite differently to how I would, using it as a description of someone who breaks traditions while I would use it to describe someone who does not rely on others for support in their personal life. When it comes to working in teams or professional environments, I would much prefer to have specific goals and instructions in order to reduce complications.</li>
      <li>Easily stressed - absolutely, I am often stressed.</li>
      <li>Live in the present - a little, though I definitely think about the past quite often.</li>
      <li>Fluctuating self-esteem - I guess my self-esteem in regard to my skills fluctuates a little but I am generally confident or at least not concerned about this.</li>
     </ul>
    <h3>Things I Do Not Have in Common:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>Spontaneous - hardly ever. I enjoy making short-term plans for upcoming events/occasions. This includes making lists, budgeting, setting timeframes and preparing. Once I have figured out if the idea is plausible and a good choice to make, then I will act on it.</li>
      <li>Live in a colourful/sensual world - no my life is fairly uneventful.</li>
      <li>Have many connections with people - I don’t look for socialisation and have only one or two friends.</li>
      <li>Like to reinterpret/reinvent/experiment with their connections, themselves and their perspectives - not really, I know I don’t stick to tradition but I’m not really going about at changing different aspect of my life.</li>
      <li>Unpredictable - I would say I am pretty predictable as I will continue on the same path unless there is a good reason for me to change. Although, the test uses this word to describe someone who does not like making long term plans, which I don’t, but that’s not how I would define the word “unpredictable” so I am a little confused about this one.</li>
      <li>After turning inwards through introversion, they return transformed.</li>
      <li>Push their passions.</li>
      <li>Are risk takers and enjoy gambling or extreme sports - definitely not, I don’t gamble and I don’t like sport much.</li>
      <li>Have an irresistible charm - no, generally people don’t seem drawn to me or repelled by me.</li>
      <li>Can be selfish and manipulative - even though I prefer to focus on myself rather than others, I actively avoid being selfish and manipulative.</li>
      <li>Imaginative - I am more practical than imaginative.</li>
      <li>Overly competitive - I can be competitive sometimes in board games but other than that, I never seek out competitive environments.</li>
      <li>Don’t like instructions and prefer to do things their own way - if the instructions are safe and achieve the goal then I will always prefer specific instructions.</li>
     </ul>
    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
     <p>These is just what I have gained from the first few pages that describe Adventurers. I do not feel like much of an Adventurer at all. Although, I did find that I learned a little about myself simply by thinking about how the description of an Adventurer probably does not fit me.</p>
    <h3>How Will These Results Affect Me and My Participation in a Team?</h3>
     <p>The results of this particular test do not mean much for me and I think will have no influence on my behaviour in a team or how I should form a team. I believe I am a pretty good team member as I like to contribute evenly, actively and enthusiastically - even if I would prefer to work on my own. It is difficult for the whole team when some members aren’t actively contributing to the team and so I personally try my best to be a helpful team member. I also do not like it when things are left undone and often find myself picking up the slack or completing the tasks that others have not.</p>
   <h2>What Is My Learning Style?</h2>
    <h3>My Perspective Prior To The Test</h3>
     <p>I have previously said in the past that I am a tactile/kinaesthetic learner and I also benefit from learning visually. This is because:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>I prefer to hand write my notes/homework before typing them up.</li>
       <li>I can often replicate drawings I did long ago.</li>
       <li>I am good at puzzles.</li>
       <li>I sometimes fiddle with objects in class.</li>
       <li>I often sketch art on all of my workbooks while listening to teachers.</li>
     <p>I find that I listen better when I am moving my hands and retain written information if I rewrite it in my own way. In a class environment, I usually I end up sketching on my books or multitasking while listening. I find that I do not learn anything and get very bored when listening to teachers unless:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>The teacher is enthusiastic.</li>
       <li>The class is fast-paced.</li>
       <li>There are visuals accompanying the voice.</li>
       <li>I am doing something with my hands and/or.</li>
       <li>If the content is appealing/challenging to me.</li>
    </ul>
